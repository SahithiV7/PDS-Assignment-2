Question2.a:

I got total 6 attributes with missing values. They are [Mileage(2), Engine(36), Power(36), Seats(38), New_Price(5032)].

Mileage, Engine and Seats - Replaced the null values with their means because we got like very few null values and all the missing value attributes are numerical, so to preserve data intrigity and for the accuracy. And coming to power attribute, it is a crucial attribute so droped the rows of the missing values.

For New_price column their are about 5042 missing values, so dropped the column.
